Upon entering the cave you notice it's full of hundereds of glowing crystals.
They illuminated the walls, ceiling, and floors of the cave.
The crystals grow from nearly every surface, but you begin to notice that there are certain parts of the cave floor where       they aren't growing.
It seems almost like the path continues into the cave.
You follow the path down into the cave.
The further into the cave you go, the less crystals there are and the rougher the path becomes.
Soon you are more of following the crystals than following a path where the crystals are absent.
After a while the crystals are few and far between, but you can always manage to see the next one in the distance.
In the dark patches you find yourself going on your hands and knees to feel for safe places to step.
The terrain has become rough enough you fear there may be holes you could fall into and get stuck in, or that could snag your   foot if you take a mistep and twist your ankle.

After traveling in this fashion for quite some time, you can see a different type of light in the distance.
The crystals glowed in bright blues and greens, but this light was yellow, red, and orange, and danced and flickered on the     cave walls.
As you get closer you can see that the light is coming from two giant pillars with a fire blazing atop each of them.
Behind the pillars there's a massive door.
That door must be the door to Hades.
But between them on the ground there's a heep of... something.
You squint your eyes to try to see it better.
You can tell it's massive, and it's made up of coils of scaley flesh.
As you get closer you notice the coils are expanding and contracing as if they're... breathing.
Then you see its huge, closed eye.
You had heard stories of giant snakes like this before and you knew the name well.
After all, if someone fought one and survived they'd tell the epic tale to anyone who would listen for the rest of their        lives.
This is not just any snake.
This is a basilisk.
Do you...
question:
choice: 1) Sneak past the basilisk.
choice: 2) Try to kill the basilisk while it's still asleep.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

<choice 1>
You try to go around the basilisk as quietly as you can, but the thing is wide enough that you can't get around it.
You'll have to go over it.
It's big enough that you can't step over its coils, so you try to jump over them. 
That's probably less likely to wake it up than climbing over them. Right?
You jump over the first coil.
.
.
The snake doesn't move.
You jump over the next coil.
. 
.
The coils of the snake start to move in different directions.
Soon the basilisk is coiled in a circle around you with its head raised in front of you.

</choice 1>
<choice 2>
You pull out your sword.
The snakes eyes snap open!
It moves quickly and before you can do anything it's coiled in a circle around you with its head raised in front of you.
