Sir Reinhold takes the practice sword from you and returns both of the practice swords to the rack.
"It seems I may have underestimated your abilities. It appears there is a chance that you won't just be monster bait."
"Guess that means I need to show you this." He says, taking a rolled up sheet of parchment out of his belt and handing it to     you.
Upon unrolling it you see that it's a map.
"To save the princess you must go from here, the castle, to Typhon's forest."
"In the forest you will find the enterance to a large cave, in which resides the enterance to Hades."
"Now, let's go to the armoury and get you some better gear."

You traverse several more corridors with Sir Reinhold as your guide, then finally you reach a metal door with four guards,       two on each side.
"State your buisness Sir Reinhold." Says the first guard on the right as you approach.
"I am here to get better gear for this young knight better gear." He replies.
"What is their quest?" the first guard on the left asks.
"To save the princess." 
The guards' stoney faces fill with shock for a second, before quickly going back to the expressionless state they've been        trained to keep.
"You may proceed." The first guard says, unlocking and opening the heavy door for you to enter.

As soon as the two of you are inside the room the door shuts behind you.
Sir Reinhold immediately starts looking over and picking up pieces of gear and mubbling to himself about their inadequacies.
Eventually he settles upon some leather armour and a fairly basic sword.
"It's important that your armour and sword be light because you're traveling quite a distance and you won't be able to           bring a horse."
He helps you put on the armour and gives you the sword's sheath belt to buckle around your own waist.
+ 3 attack
+ 3 defense

After successfully preparing you for your quest, Sir Reinhold leads you out of the castle.
"You're on your own now young knight." Sir Reinhold says before turning around to walk back into the castle.
"Follow that map and you'll get there, assuming you don't get killed."
And with that very encouraging fairwell, you set out into the forest.
