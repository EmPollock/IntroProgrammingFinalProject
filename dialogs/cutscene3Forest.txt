At first, your journey is fairly uneventful.
You walk along the dirt path, checking the map every so often to make sure you're still on course.
After walking for several hours you notice that the sun is going down and it's getting dark fast. 
Do you:
question:
choice: 1) Keep walking. You want to get to the cave as soon as possible.
choice: 2) Find a clearing near the path and set up camp for the night. Darkness means more danger, besides, you could use some rest.

You continue walking down the path.
You hear a soft clink and feel something small fall out of your armour and hit your leg before bouncing onto the ground.
You look on the ground, and in the little light that is still left you see a gold coin.
Sir Reinhold must have put it there, though why you're not sure.
You pick it up and study it.
It's not like the kingdoms coins that you're used to, it seems much... older.
You put the coin in your pocket and continue walking.
By now it's dark and you think you might hear something in the forest.
You shake it off, thinking it's probably your imagination. 
You are very tired, afterall.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

After some more walking you hear the sound again, but louder.
It sounds a bit like the sound of many branches striking the ground in quick succession.
You debate whether or not to search for the source of the noises when you see a faint glow in the direction the sound is       coming from.
The glow rapidly approaches you and you can start to see what it is.
It's a giant insect, about as tall as you are, with big red glowing patches near its mouth and giant pinsers; A giant fire      beetle.
The beetle spots you at the same time you spot it and charges towards you.

<choice 2>

You find a clearing fairly close to the path.
You take off your armour and set out your bed roll.
While you're taking off your armour, you feel something small fall and hit your leg before bouncing onto the ground.
A gold coin.
Sir Reinhold must have put it there, though why you're not sure.
You pick it up and study it.
It's not like the kingdoms coins that you're used to, it seems much... older.
You put the coin in your pocket.
You decide not to make a fire, it's summer so you don't need the extra warmth, and light can attract some creatures you'd       rather not deal with.
You fall asleep more easily than you would expect for sleeping on a thin mat on the hard ground.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

You slowly wake up and notice it's still night.
You were awoken by a faint sound in the forest.
You decide to go back to sleep, but your uneasiness makes it much harder than the last time you tried to fall asleep.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

The sound continues throughout your restlessness.
You can make it out better now, but it is still an unfamilliar sound.
It sounds a bit like the sound of many branches striking the ground in quick succession.
Because the noise apears to be getting louder you decide to get up and investigate it.
You look into the forest in the direction of the sound and see a faint glow.
You quickly put on your armour.
As you finish strapping on the last piece you finally get a good look at the glowing thing that has been rapidly approaching.
It's a giant insect, about as tall as you are, with big red glowing patches near its mouth and giant pinsers; A giant fire      beetle.
By now it's very close to your camp.
It spots you and charges at you.
