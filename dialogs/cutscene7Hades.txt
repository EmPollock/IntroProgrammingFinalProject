When you reach the bottom of the stairway, you find yourself in a firey landscape near the bank of a black river.
On each side of the river there is a chared dock.
Standing on the dock on the same side of the river as you is a man wearing a cloak, holding the rope of a small boat that's     floating in the water.
You approach the man.
"One golden drachma for passage." The man says holding out his hand.
Do you:
question:
choice: 1) Ask "Who are you? And what's a drachma?"
choice: 2) Give him the coin you found earlier.

"My name is Charon, I bring the souls of the dead over the river Styx, for a price of course." He replies.
"That price being a golden drachma, which you should have been buried with. If not you're out of luck."
"Oh, you mean this?" You say pulling the coin you found earlier out of your pocket.
"Yes, that. Now do you want to cross the river or not? I don't have all day."

Charon expertly guides the boat accross the river and soon you're on the other side.
As soon as you get out of the boat it disappears.
You look back accross the river.
Charon is somehow already back at the other dock with his boat ready to carry more passangers.
You look back away from the river and notice a long winding path that goes through the barren burning land.
You follow the trail for quite some time, off of the trail you can see many spirits undergoing strange punishments.
Some of the more memorable include one who would push a giant bolder up a mountain, only for it to roll down the other side     and the whole process to repeat again,
and another who was stuck on an island with a fruit tree in the middle of a pool of water, but everytime he went to reach for   the fruit or tried to take a drink of water, it would recoil away from him.
You continue following the path as it winds over and around hills, past many spirits in torment, until you can finally see      the castle gates.
Outside of the castle gates there is a large three headed dog with a large metal collar around each of its heads and  a        chain  for each keeping it near the gate.
The collars all read 'Cerberus'.
As you approach, one of the three heads notices you and starts growling, alerting the other two to your presence as well.
You draw your sword to prepare for the fight.
